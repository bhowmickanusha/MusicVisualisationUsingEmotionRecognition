# MusicVisualisationUsingEmotionRecognition
Currently, this is for Hindustani Classical Music. Aims to apply ML to classify a classical music audio clip into an emotion class, and use this emotion class to visually represent the audio temporally. Future work will look towards applying the same methodology for better visual representation and expansion for all genres of music.
